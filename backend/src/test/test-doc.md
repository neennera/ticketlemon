# Testing Website Performance

jest / postman

We'll test 3 things :

1. unit testing for API, using jest
2. load testing using postman automation
3. website performance / component testing : jmeter / k6

## API testing

Firstly, I'm uncertain what tools to choose, postman or jest. Base on my research, jest is more in code-base and unit testing (even it has supertest for API). Jest is likely to simple API test. For that reason, I choose postman.
